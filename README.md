# ganother-world

GOAL:
- Learn GO and implement "something fun"
- "something fun" - interpret the old game another world and create a web version!

# ARCHITECTURE

- Split Backend (parsing, interpreting) and Frontend (rendering audio & video).
- Backend should build as lib so it can be reusable in a web app (WASM target) or SDL2 app
- Local assets are here for dev purpose only - they will go away. thread them as they will be downloaded

# EPICS

- Basic Project Bootstrap
- Design GO library
- Resource Management: read MEMLIST.BIN, read resources
- Setup Video and Audio
- VM parser
- implement VM op codes (Polygons drawing)
- Audio / Sound FX (Protracker module)

# Getting started

- Install make (autotools on linux, xcode on OSX)
- Install go 1.13 https://golang.org/dl/
- Check out repo
- Run `./scripts/osx-install.sh` to install/download dependencies or make sure SDL2 (sdl2, sdl2_gfx, sdl2_image, sdl2_mixer, sdl_net) is installed correctly
- Run `make` to build, if it's green you're good
- Use `make help` for more
