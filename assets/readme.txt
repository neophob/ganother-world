        CONFIGURATION AND OPTIONS

        The  program  will automatically detect your graphic card and sound

        if  you wish, either by using the config program (CONFIG.EXE) or by
        specifying the options at the start of the game, by typing  one  or
        more  of  the  following  commands after the word ANOTHER (insert a
        space between each command).

                V = VGA graphics card
                E = EGA graphics card
                T = TGA graphics card
                S = SOUNDBLASTER music card

                H = INTERNAL SPEAKER for digitised sound
                K = KEYBOARD control method (see KEYBOARD CONTROLS below)
                J = ANALOG JOYSTICK control method
                C = JOYSTICK CALIBERATION (see JOYSTICK below)
                1 = HIGH QUALITY SOUND/MUSIC (see MUSIC/SOUND below)
                2 = MEDIUM QUALITY SOUND/MUSIC (see MUSIC/SOUND below)
                N = NO SOUND OR MUSIC (see MUSIC/SOUND below)

        e.g.  if  you wish to use VGA and SoundBlaster type ANOTHER V S and
        press enter.


        MUSIC/SOUND

        Another World features digitised  music  and  sound  effects  on  4
        channels,  which  takes  up a considerable amount of memory. If you
        have a slow PC this may result in slower  graphical  animation.  We
        would  advise  the following to enable you to get maximum enjoyment
        from the product:

                only use a joystick if you can't manage without.

                do not use EMM (EMM386, 2EMM  etc.)  memory  manager.  Some
                versions  of  these memory managers take up much memory and
                slow the game down.

                if the game is slow, use option 2  (type  ANOTHER  2);  the
                sound  effects will be medium quality but the game will run
                faster.

                if all else fails to speed up the game  enough  use  the  N
                option (type ANOTHER N)


        JOYSTICK

        If  the  joystick  control is not sensitive enough for you, you can
        caliberate it by using option C (type ANOTHER C).


        KEYBOARD CONTROLS

        Use the cursor  keys  on  the  numeric  keypad  to  move  the  main
        character.

        Fire button is any of the following:

                Space Bar.
                Enter on the main keyboard.
                Enter on the numeric keypad.
                5 between 4 and 6 on the numeric keypad.

        Press  C  at  any  time  during  the  game to access the code entry
        screen. Codes will be given to you at the time  of  the character's
        death.  Entering a code will start you at the relevant start point,
        rather than having to start at the beginning every time you play.

        To switch the sound on or off press S. However do not  expect  this
        to work if you have chosen the N (no sound) option.

        To pause the game press P. To resume play press any key.

        To exit the game back to DOS press ALT - X
